\section{Conclusion}
With the growing number of mobile devices owned by ordinary citizens all around the world and an increase of their participation in the network traffic generation and data provided, the problem of an evaluation of the trust, which other collaborators may have in the quality and security of their data and devices becomes more and more important. The presented trust evaluation framework includes procedures and tools to evaluate trust in mobile devices and applications, in particular in Android based smartphones. The framework hierarchical structure allows for incorporating multiple diverse factors affecting trust evaluation as well as facilitates its extension.
The current framework version includes the evaluation procedures based on the analysis of the following factors: the content of applications installed and executed, the deviceâ€™s operating system settings and configuration, level of privacy supported by the devices and applications, patterns of the battery drain and CPU and network bandwidth usage. The conducted empirical study demonstrated a significant difference between the change of voltage in the cases of an execution of normal applications and the same applications with embedded additions, such as for example advertising. Another study produced distinguished patterns of the CPU and network use.
The framework includes not only the procedures of the trust evaluation but also the methods of its verification. 
Trust verification and adjustment could be performed through comparison of data received from different data sources on the 
same device as well as by comparing the data originated from various devices. The significant discourse between data 
originated from various sources should results in decreasing trust assessment for the corresponding data sources and devices. 
In the paper, we have described a comparative study of the speed measurements obtained from a car speedometer sensor and the speed calculated 
with the GPS location sensor measurements. This illustrates how the framework could be employed not only for trust evaluation 
but also for detecting various anomalies, which might include malicious attacks against the mobile devices.
