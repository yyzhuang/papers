\title{A Trust Evaluation Framework for Mobile Devices and Applications}
\author{Bart}

\begin{abstract}
Evaluating trust
 is a challenge for many computer systems.  Smartphones and mobile devices install software from a 
wide range of sources.  As these devices become
more popular, the risks of associated malware will become more significant.
One of the features of these platforms is that they are rich in
sensors\footnote{In this work, smartphone sensors are broadly defined as hardware components that can record phenomena about the physical world.}.  These sensors can be a risk to privacy in that they could leak information about the 
user and user activities.  On the other side, they can also be used as an
advantage if they can be used to evaluate trust.
%leak information about any malware that is running on it.  

This paper builds  a hierarchical security evaluation 
\yanyan{eval security or trust?} framework 
that uses sensors to evaluate trust and detect anomalies. We examine the results 
of two empirical studies where this framework is applied.  
The first study involves monitoring resource utilization.  For example, malicious code 
injected into an app or OS utility could manifest as an increased consumption in 
system resources, such as CPU or network communication. Sensor values like battery level 
and CPU utilization can detect this.  The second study involves erroneous sensor values. 
For example, malwares that could produce an intentional or inadvertant effect on sensors, such 
as accelerometers and GPS receivers, could be detected by measuring anomalies 
in these sensor values. Our approach is two-fold: evaluating trust based on metrics 
and models, \yanyan{more specific what the metrics and models are?} and 
using this evaluation to detect anomalies as a way to improve security in general.


\eat{For many people, smartphones and other mobile devices serve as a technical interface to the modern world.
These smart devices have embedded on-board sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, GPS sensors, and
cameras, which are very useful.

This work describes \sysname, a hierarchical framework for checking consistency of sensors 
from multiple devices.  In addition, it relies on Blursense, a dynamic, fine-grained, flexible access
control mechanism, acting as a line of defense that allows users to define and addprivacy filters. 
As a result, the user can expose filtered sensor data to untrusted apps, and researchers can collect 
data in a way that safeguards users' privacy.}  %end comment
