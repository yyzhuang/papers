\begin{abstract}
Trust evaluation of complex and diverse systems, such as an ad-hoc network 
of mobile devices, is a significant challenge in both theory and practice. 
In order to manage the complexity, we develop a hierarchical trust 
evaluation methodology that fuses trust evaluation metrics of individual devices 
and their components, and verifies and adjusts the overall trust evaluation 
based on the consistency of data from multiple devices.
  
%Smartphones  are rich in sensors and network easily with other mobile devices and wearable computers.

\eat{
  Smartphones and mobile devices install software from a 
wide range of sources.  As these devices become
more popular, the risks of associated malware will become more significant.
One of the features of these platforms is that they are rich in
sensors\footnote{In this work, smartphone sensors are broadly defined as hardware components that can record phenomena about the physical world.}.  These sensors can be a risk to privacy in that they could leak information about the 
user and user activities.  On the other side, they can also be used as an
advantage if they can be used to evaluate trust.
%leak information about any malware that is running on it.  
This paper builds  a hierarchical trust evaluation 
 framework 
that uses sensors to evaluate trust and detect anomalies.

The paper describes the hierarchical trust evaluation framework 
developed and tested for Android based smartphones. The 
framework operation involves two stages: initial trust evaluation 
based on the expert rules application, and the 
evaluation scheme verification and adjustment based on the analysis 
and comparison of data, which might be extracted from various mobile 
devices. We examine the results of two empirical studies, in which 
this framework is applied and tested. The first study involves 
monitoring resource utilization and evaluating trust based on 
resource consumption patterns. For example, malicious code injected 
into an app or OS utility typically results in an increased consumption of 
system resources, such as CPU or network communication. 
%Sensor values like battery level 
%and CPU utilization can detect this.  The second study uses a comparison of erroneous sensor values
%from the GPS sensor on a smartphone with speed data from the OBD port on an automobile.
%These are examples in which malware could produce an intentional or inadvertant effect on sensors, such 
%ass GPS receivers or a speedometer, and could be detected by measuring anomalies 
%in these sensor values. 
The second study involves verification of the trust evaluation by 
comparing the measurement results coming from the smartphone 
GPS location sensors against an external speedometer sensor in a car.
\eat{
Our approach is two-fold: evaluating trust based on metrics 
and models, \yanyan{more specific what the metrics and models are?} and 
using this evaluation to detect anomalies as a way to improve security in general.} % end comment

\eat{For many people, smartphones and other mobile devices serve as a technical interface to the modern world.
These smart devices have embedded on-board sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, GPS sensors, and
cameras, which are very useful.

This work describes \sysname, a hierarchical framework for checking consistency of sensors 
from multiple devices.  In addition, it relies on Blursense, a dynamic, fine-grained, flexible access
control mechanism, acting as a line of defense that allows users to define and addprivacy filters. 
As a result, the user can expose filtered sensor data to untrusted apps, and researchers can collect 
data in a way that safeguards users' privacy.}  %end comment
