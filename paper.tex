\title{A Trust Evaluation Framework for Mobile Devices and Applications}
\author{Bart}

\begin{abstract}
Evaluating trust
 is a challenge for any computer system.  Smartphones and mobile devices install software from a 
wide range of sources.  As smartphones and other mobile devices become
more popular, the risks of associated malware will become more significant.
One of the features of these platforms is that they are rich in
sensors.  This can be a risk to privacy in that they could leak information about the user.  It can also be an
advantage if they can be used to evaluate trust.
%leak information about any malware that is running on it.  
This paper builds on  \sysname,  a hierarchical security evaluation framework 
that has been implemented on Android smartphones.
This paper examines two cases where this framework can be applied.  
The first case involves monitoring resource utilization.  A malware parasite, e.g. malicious code 
that has been injected into a useful App or OS utility,
could manifest as an increase in CPU or communication processing.
The battery sensor would detect this.  
Similarly, malware that could produce an intentional or inadvertant effect on sensors such as accelerometers
and GPS receivers could be detected
by measuring anomalies in the GPS values.
Our approach is two-fold: evaluating trust based on metrics and models; and 
using this evaluation to detect anomalies as a way to improve security in general.


\eat{For many people, smartphones and other mobile devices serve as a technical interface to the modern world.
These smart devices have embedded on-board sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, GPS sensors, and
cameras, which are very useful.

This work describes \sysname, a hierarchical framework for checking consistency of sensors 
from multiple devices.  In addition, it relies on Blursense, a dynamic, fine-grained, flexible access
control mechanism, acting as a line of defense that allows users to define and addprivacy filters. 
As a result, the user can expose filtered sensor data to untrusted apps, and researchers can collect 
data in a way that safeguards users' privacy.}  %end comment
